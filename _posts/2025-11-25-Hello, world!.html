<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p class="p">
	Welcome to my website! I am Nixii, and I am a programming & music nerd.
</p>

<h2>What is this website for?</h2>
<p class="p">
	This website is for anything I want to add. Posts will contain whatever pops into my head. I will publish here what I feel like should be. This is a
	personal website, after all.
</p>
<p class="p">
	You might notice that some of the posts on this site are not in English. These articles are most likely written in <a href="https://tokipona.org/">toki pona</a>,
	a small and really fun language to learn. Sometimes I feel like expressing myself in it, therefore some of my posts will be written entirely in
	toki pona, and most likely will <span class="italic">not</span> have a translation. o pona!
</p>

<h2>How was this site made?</h2>
<p class="p">
	This site was created with the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll framework</a>. If you want to make a simple website similar to this, 
	I cannot recommend Jekyll enough. It makes default page layouts and loading page posts a <span class="italic">breeze</span>.
	However, Jekyll only supports <span class="bold">static</span> websites, so if you want comments or user-generated content, it's not right for you.
	But for simple sites like this, it is great.
</p>

<h2>Thank you!</h2>
<p class="p">
	Thank you for taking the time to read this post! More will come in the future, and some will actually be useful.
