<p class="p">
	I've been a programmer for the majority of my life, starting with Scratch at the age of seven. My lineage is one of engineers, and I too inherited the genes of enjoying technology. I've always been intrigued with being able to make a computer do what I want it to, leading to me furthering my studies and learning Python.
</p>

<p class="p">
	Oceanography is an enthralling subject that I have been surrounded by for most of my life as well. Being born near the Pacific, I've explored the California coasts many times, inspiring me to learn more and more about the systems at work and how life can thrive in such a turbulent environment. I eventually started volunteering for baylands restoration programs, which inspired me to study marine conservation. In the summer of 2025, I travelled to North Carolina to volunteer at the <span class="bold">Karen Beasley Sea Turtle Rescue and Rehabilitation Center</span>, which only reinforced my interest in conserving these incredible creatures.
</p>

<br> <p class="p">
	Now that I have been studying programming for many years, I have gained a wide variety of skills. I can program in <span class="bold">C, Lua, Python, Rust, JavaScript, and Java</span>, and I can quickly learn others that I need to with documentation. I understand the core of how computer programs function, giving me a deeper understanding than most people as to how my code will be run.
</p>

<p class="p">
	In my free time, I tend to either spend time with friends, work on my own personal programming projects and studies, or create music. The process of creation is always exciting for me, so I end up taking breaks from my CS homework to work on my own CS projects.
