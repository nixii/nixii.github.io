			Hello, I am Nixii! I am a California-based programmer, music producer, conservation volunteer, 
			and high school student. I've been programming for the majority of my life and hope to use that 
			skill to assist in conservation efforts.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm also interested in linguistics and the art of communication. I speak English and toki 
			pona fluently. I speak some Mandarin and Spanish as well, 但我最好多学习。
		</p>
		<p>
			I also prefer being concise, but I sometimes use many filler words. I'm trying!

<h3>Programming <span class="sp">toki ilo la</span></h3>
<p class="p">
	I started programming very young, originally in scratch. I currently enjoy programming in C and Lua, but I am proficient in other languages, such as Python,
	Javascript, and Go.
</p>
<p class="p">
	My most recent creation is this website, which I have coded entirely from scratch. My other creations will be found on the <a href="/projects">project page</a>.
</p>

<h3>Music <span class="sp">kalama musi la</span></h3>
<p class="p">
	I enjoy listening to great music and creating mediocre music. You can find these on the <a href="/music">music page</a>.
</p>
<p class="p">
	I've been creating music for a few years, and I think it is one of the greatest forms of art that humanity has. 
	Music has the power to invoke many feelings within people, and I think that is powerful.
</p>

<h3>Oceanic conservation <span class="sp">telo suli la</span></h3>
<p class="p">
	The ocean is an incredible biome. So many intertwined systems tie together to make some of the most unique
	ecologies this world has. However, these environments are being rapidly destroyed by human activities.
</p>
<p class="p">
	For this reason, we <span class="italic">need</span> people to help support conservation efforts. I urge you
	to look for an organization you can volunteer at to help save our oceans. If we work together, we can protect
	these intricate biomes!
</p>

<h3>Visual art <span class="sp">sitelen la</span></h3>
<p class="p">
	I've recently been trying to improve my drawing ability. I enjoy art and want to be able to create my own whenever I have some idea.
</p>

<h3>Final note <span class="sp">toki pini la</span></h3>
<p class="p">
	If there is any information missing from this site, feel free to send me a message to
	any of my accounts, found at the bottom of every page. Some information is omitted for
	personal privacy, of course, but I am <span class="italic">always</span> okay with questions!
</p>
<p class="p">
	<span class="sp">o pona!</span> Be good!
